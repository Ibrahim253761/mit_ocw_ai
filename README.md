My solutions to the MIT OpenCourseWare AI class homework assignments.

Asssignments and lectures are taken from the Fall 2010 6.034 course taught by Prof. Patrick Henry Winston:

Final Results
=============
All my solutions pass all the included offline tests, with the exception of hw5. The two tests that fail are for the "vampires worst on test" and "classifiers for best ensemble". I answers I included are the answers I got to the best of my ability. The homework assignment does mention that the orange suites seem to depend on architecture, so it is possible my architecture or future updates to Orange might have changed the behavior.
